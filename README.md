# SMAPITackleDurabilityMod
Adjusts the fishing tackle durability in Stardew Valley using SMAPI

###How to modify the durability: 

1. Open the config.json file
2. Modify the durability modifier to your liking

###Settings:

-"durabilityModifier": 1.0+  = Infinite Durability
-"durabilityModifier": 0.75  = 4x Durability
-"durabilityModifier": 0.5   = 2x Durability
-"durabilityModifier": -0.5  = 1/2 Durability
-"durabilityModifier": -0.75 = 1/4 Durability

###WARNING:
These modifications will only occur when hooking a fish, trash will ALWAYS decrease at the normal rate.
(If infinite durability is set, the next fish will restore the bar completely)
